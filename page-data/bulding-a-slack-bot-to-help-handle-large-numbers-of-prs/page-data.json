The book is about 10x deeper than the normal handwavey product advice you hear and ever so worth the time investment to wrap your head around its ideas.</p>\n<p>On a recent plane ride, I skimmed through the book looking for ideas to help us get a better handle on all the PRs we get.</p>\n<h2>The Economic Basis of Product Development</h2>\n<p>Chapter 2 jumps into what the author considers the most important subject of the book ‚Äî how to determine the economic value of any work you might be doing. If you can‚Äôt determine that, than any other measures you might take to guide product development are on shaky foundations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As obvious as this may seem, this economic view of product development is surprisingly uncommon. Instead, product developers create a large number of proxy objectives: increase innovation, improve quality, conform to plan, shorten development cycles, eliminate waste, etc. Unfortunately, they rarely understand how these proxy objectives quantitatively influence profits. Without this quantitative mapping, they cannot evaluate decisions that affect multiple interacting objectives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He dislikes proxies :-)</p>\n<p>We should measure what we actually care about ‚Äî does some work contribute to the company‚Äôs mission and bottom line (directly or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H4XD40/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&#x26;btkr=1\">indirectly</a>).</p>\n<p>Clearly for Gatsby, we think PRs and the people writing the PRs are valuable ‚Äî in the sense that our mission is to directly help build people and communities and to create tools that empower people and organizations. We want contributors because participating in Open Source directly helps their career and their contributions directly improves Gatsby which benefits everyone using it and the better Gatsby becomes, the more viable our commerical products &#x26; services become ‚Äî which viability is what sustains and drives the whole process.</p>\n<h2>Managing queues</h2>\n<p>The next chapter is on ‚ÄúManaging Queues‚Äù. Really fun stuff.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the last chapter, I showed you how to use an economic framework to guide your product development decisions. When we use such a framework, we often discover that cycle time has high economic leverage. If we can find cheap ways to reduce cycle time, our profits go up. But what causes long product development cycle time?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He dives into the theory of queues and how to manage queues ‚Äî particularly when they get too long. Which theory was largely invented by a mathematician named Agner Karup Erlang (where have I heard that name before‚Ä¶ü§î) at the Copehhangen Telephone Company who in 1909 was trying to determine how many phone lines were needed for a specific number of people.</p>\n<p>The main principle from there we‚Äôve taken to heart at Gatsby is principle 4: ‚Äú<strong>The Principle of High-Queue States: Most of the damage done by a queue is caused by high-queue states.</strong>‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHigh-queue states‚Äù means in our context ‚Äî too many PRs. PR count naturally flucuates as PRs come in semi-randomly and core maintainers have time to review and merge them. Sometimes these natural fluctuations mean the PR count soars to unusually high numbers. If not taken care of rapidly, this means the whole process of reviews will get bogged down.</p>\n<p>The current rule we‚Äôve adopted is that 115 PRs is a warning state when more people should shift over to working on PRs and 130 is red state when everyone should stop what they‚Äôre doing to focus on PRs.</p>\n<p>This has been very successful as in the past, we‚Äôd at times get into 140+ PR count range and it‚Äôd kinda sit there for a few days until someone would finally heroically drive it down. Now PRs tend toward a 100-115 count and we rarely move past that for long.</p>\n<h2>Multiple classes of queues?</h2>\n<p>But it didn‚Äôt still feel like we were measuring things correctly. We‚Äôve been inconsistent at responding to PRs and sometimes valuable PRs have slipped through the cracks and sat untouched for months. E.g. at the recent Drupalcon, an engineer came up to me after my talk and mentioned he‚Äôd opened a PR that hadn‚Äôt gotten merged. I looked and it was a great PR and luckily <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SchauDustin\">Dustin Schau</a> (also at the conferece) was able to review and merge it immediately. Luckily the developer was still in the middle of his Gatsby/Drupal project and hadn‚Äôt had to go into production with this bug unfixed.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs really bad when fixes like this don‚Äôt get reviewed and merged promptly. Not only is the contributor still having to work around the bug but unknown number of other users are also facing the same bug (and perhaps not able to work around it‚Äîmeaning they might abandon Gatsby altogether). But even worse, if we fail to help the contributor quickly, they might end up feeling a bit snubbed and that we don‚Äôt want them contributing. We never know which casual first contribution, treated really well, is going to turn into a repeat contributor who invests deeply in the project and makes it their own.</p>\n<p>So with this in mind, I was reading chapter 6 on applying WIP constraints and ran across this principle:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Principle of the Critical Queue: Constrain WIP in the section of the system where the queue is most expensive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It occurred to me that PRs weren‚Äôt actually <em>one</em> queue but many. And that the different queues had different costs. A PR that has been opened and not reviewed is very different than a PR that was reviewed and is now awaiting contributor feedback.</p>\n<p>The first PR might be from a new contributor who needs to be made felt welcome and appreciated. The first PR might have a fix for a critical bug that‚Äôs affecting a lot of people. <em>Not</em> reviewing the first PR is very expensive.</p>\n<p>The second PR, on the other hand, can sit for a bit while the contributor comes across more free time to respond to suggestions.</p>\n<h2>Applying WIP constraints to PR queues</h2>\n<p>The trick now was how to identify the different queues and apply WIP constraints. When you think of PRs as hemogenous, then the normal GitHub PR view is great ‚Äî you can view new PRs, the oldest PRs, etc. But when you want to split PRs up into different queues, lumping PRs into a single queue becomes a problem. The mass of PRs awaiting review are getting in the way of finding the few PRs that haven‚Äôt been reviewed!</p>\n<p>So time for some custom code.</p>\n<p>I didn‚Äôt want to create a new ‚Äúview‚Äù of the different PR queues, but I wanted to apply WIP constraints ‚Äî prevent the high cost queues from growing too large. And the easiest way to do that it seemed was to create a Slack bot that‚Äôd tell us when there were unreviewed PRs.</p>\n<h2>OneGraph</h2>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://www.onegraph.com/\">OneGraph</a> ‚Äî whose tagline sums things up nicely: ‚ÄúWe handle the messy integration work.  You focus on the interesting problems.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Their mission resonates deeply with me as Gatsby is focused on a similar problem (in part) ‚Äî how to get data out of APIs into websites without ‚Äúmessy integration work‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Anyone who‚Äôs worked with APIs know they‚Äôre often a riot (the bad sort, not e.g. a riot of color) of poorly documented &#x26; inconsistent APIs locked behind authentication systems that seem just as determined to keep you out of your data as the bad actors. This isn‚Äôt a GraphQL vs. REST article but it‚Äôs hard not to mention that the excessively freeform nature of REST APIs pretty much guerentees this üòú (This is not a knock against all the hard-working API teams out there ‚Äî it‚Äôs just API design is a <em>hard</em> problem and the lack of built-in constraints in most APIs doesn‚Äôt help).</p>\n<p>Anyways, OneGraph does a great job of fixing that by wrapping all the messiness of integrating with APIs into a consistent GraphQL based UI. Just look how beautiful this view from their dashboard is:</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/686582e2684a4df1165f0640f9c7c966/10e91/onegraph%20screenshot.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 568px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 113.51351351351352%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"onegraph screenshot\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/686582e2684a4df1165f0640f9c7c966/10e91/onegraph%20screenshot.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/686582e2684a4df1165f0640f9c7c966/12f09/onegraph%20screenshot.png 148w,\n/static/686582e2684a4df1165f0640f9c7c966/e4a3f/onegraph%20screenshot.png 295w,\n/static/686582e2684a4df1165f0640f9c7c966/10e91/onegraph%20screenshot.png 568w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Just click on a provider, authenticate via oauth, and you‚Äôre off.

OneGraph has a very nice ‚ÄúCode Exporter‚Äù that gives you starter code to run your queries from browser code or in node.js.

I went back and forth between tweaking output in Slack‚Äôs design tool and applying those tweaks to the script until I had something I liked.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9a1e0d98577d65dbebe9e883b3e66c40/c1bea/Screenshot%202019-04-22%2018.31.26.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 97.2972972972973%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Screenshot 2019-04-22 18.31.26\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/9a1e0d98577d65dbebe9e883b3e66c40/fcda8/Screenshot%202019-04-22%2018.31.26.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9a1e0d98577d65dbebe9e883b3e66c40/12f09/Screenshot%202019-04-22%2018.31.26.png 148w,\n/static/9a1e0d98577d65dbebe9e883b3e66c40/e4a3f/Screenshot%202019-04-22%2018.31.26.png 295w,\n/static/9a1e0d98577d65dbebe9e883b3e66c40/fcda8/Screenshot%202019-04-22%2018.31.26.png 590w,\n/static/9a1e0d98577d65dbebe9e883b3e66c40/efc66/Screenshot%202019-04-22%2018.31.26.png 885w,\n/static/9a1e0d98577d65dbebe9e883b3e66c40/c83ae/Screenshot%202019-04-22%2018.31.26.png 1180w,\n/static/9a1e0d98577d65dbebe9e883b3e66c40/c1bea/Screenshot%202019-04-22%2018.31.26.png 1388w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Running the script once a day</h2>\n<p>Now to a classic programming problem ‚Äî how to run your code every so often?

We only use Slack for those of us who work at Gasby Inc. A public dashboard with the same info is necessary to let everyone help out with high value PRs + it provides public accountability for how well we‚Äôre doing.</li>\n<li><strong>Alert more frequently on really high value queues</strong> ‚Äî e.g. PRs that have been reviewed and accepted and whose tests are now passing. Those just need a click of the merge button and publish for the fix or improvement to out in the wild.</li>\n<li><strong>Add <a href=\"https://kanbantool.com/cumulative-flow-diagram\">Cumulative Flow Diagrams (CFD)</a></strong>. Very useful tool (the book says its the most useful tool for managing queues) to visualize in and out going PRs.
