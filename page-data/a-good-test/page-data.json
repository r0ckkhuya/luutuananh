The end of another semester\nbrings with it that joyful tradition, finals. Going through six finals gave me\ncause to think quite a bit about tests; what are they for and why are they\nuseful?</p>\n<p>I came up with three ways to measure the quality of a test:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Does it measure something valuable?</li>\n<li>Is the test both reliable and valid?</li>\n<li>Does it provide the correct incentives?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Does it measure something valuable?</strong>  This depends on the context of the\ntest — a juggling test is valuable for a circus school, a gum chewing test is\nvaluable to aspiring gum gurus, etc. The important questions is, does the test\nmeasure one’s understanding of or skill in the valuable part(s) of a subject\nmatter.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the test both reliable and valid?</strong>  Reliable means the test is\nconsistently administered and graded for all test takers. Valid means the test\nmeasures what it intends to. A juggling test which asks a student to hold two\nballs but not throw them would be a reliable test — all test takers could be\nmeasured easily the same — but wouldn’t be valid as being able to hold two\nballs doesn’t show that one can in fact juggle balls. A professor can prepare\na test that measures all students fairly but wouldn’t test the students on\nanything valuable (as defined above).</p>\n<p><strong>Does it provide the correct incentives?</strong>  I haven’t worked this measure out\nsatisfactorily in my mind yet but it’s something like the following. People’s\nbehavior is shaped by incentives. Because tests are a major part of a class\ngrade and most students care about grades, tests motivate students to study\nmore then they would without the incentive. So far this is fine and dandy.\nI for one appreciate tests for this very reason as I know I’ve studied more,\nand learned more, over the years because of tests.</p>\n<p><strong>So why can this go wrong?</strong>  Students go to school to learn, presumably.\nThere is of course the old yarn that education is the only thing that Americans\npay for and hope to be cheated. Many students it seems care more about the\ngrade then for learning. Because learning is hard, there is a strong incentive\nfor students to try to ‘game’ the test. Some types of tests can be passed by\ncramming the night before the tests. Tests that only require you to memorize\nmaterial don’t promote true learning. So this poorer sort of test would provide\nthe wrong incentive to students in that it pushes them toward the poorer sort\nof learning. A good test would push students toward the richer, and harder,\nsort of learning.</p>\n<p>Now what types of tests provide the correct or wrong incentives I’m not quite\nsure. As I said, I haven’t completely worked this measure out. I’m not even\nsure if it is a correct measure. If at some point I can work up more interest\nin this topic to clarify my thinking, I’ll write another post. Or someone else\ncan save me the work and write it themselves (or link to a page in the comments\nsection).</p>","excerpt":"I recently finished up a semester at BYU.
