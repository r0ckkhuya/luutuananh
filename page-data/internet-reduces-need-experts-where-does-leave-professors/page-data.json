In this brave new world with near ubiquitous digital knowledge, what then are professors good for?</p>\n<p>They aren’t nearly as valuable at teaching explicit knowledge so what’s left is to teach tacit knowledge (knowledge that’s hard to learn from reading). What tacit knowledge? I’d suggest the most important tacit knowledge that professors can help students learn is how to ask the right questions in their field. How do students learn to ask the right questions? By joining and <strong>participating</strong> in communities of practice.</p>\n<p>I see Island’s (and other web2.0 tools) greatest potential is in exposing and connecting students more easily to active participants in different communities of practice. Through this exposure and connections they can learn to emulate these experts through experiencing and doing what experts experience and do.</p>\n<p>Good learning is learning to <strong>be</strong> something not learning <strong>about</strong> something. I might know everything a book can teach me about chemistry but still fail miserably at being a chemist. I might be able to pass every grammar test in existence but still not be able to write a sensible essay. Learning split from its context is worthless.</p>\n<p>Some of my most valuable classes here at BYU were taught by active participants in their community of practice. By watching them practice their craft, I learned what it meant to <strong>be</strong> a member of that community and what it meant to <strong>practice</strong> that community’s craft.</p>\n<p>So what then are professors good for? I believe as guides. They can lead students into communities of practice and can model proper behavior and attitudes. And once students are <strong>in</strong> the community of practice, professors can help students choose appropriate experiences that will help them move through the stages between novice to expert.</p>","excerpt":"[I wrote this originally on Island, the student learning website I’m building at BYU.] Clay Shirky writes: Credentialed experts the world…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/education/","/tags/internet/","/tags/experts/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Internet reduces need for experts.
