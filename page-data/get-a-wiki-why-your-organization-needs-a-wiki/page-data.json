Free information from the grips of the inbox.</p>\n<h3>Low cost</h3>\n<p>While there are plenty of commercial wiki companies that’d love to sell you a wiki — and provide great value, there’s no excuse for not jumping into the wiki world with the large number of great free open-source wikis available.
