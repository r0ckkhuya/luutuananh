I’ve been learning and using <a href=\"http://nodejs.org\">Node.js</a> and <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone.js</a> the past few months and building a chatroom seemed like a great project to stretch my skills.</p>\n<p>I’ve recently pronounced it “finished” and the <a href=\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/Eduglu-Chatroom\">code is available on Github</a>. There are a few obscure bugs left but by and large, it’s plenty stable for those wanting a chatroom on Drupal 6.x.</p>\n<p>The feature should work with any site using Spaces and Organic Groups. The demo site I setup, for example, is using a default installation of <a href=\"http://openatrium.com/\">Open Atrium.</a></p>\n<h2>Technology stack</h2>\n<p>The chatroom is built using a now fairly standard set of technologies. For the backend, I used Node.js, <a href=\"http://redis.io\">Redis</a>, and MySQL. I used <a href=\"http://socket.io\">Socket.io</a> for sending the chat messages between clients and the server. I used <a href=\"http://brunchwithcoffee.com\">Brunch</a> to build the frontend. Brunch bundles together a number of really nice tools for building single-page Javascript apps including <a href=\"http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/\">Coffeescript</a>, <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone.js</a>, <a href=\"http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/\">Underscore.js</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sstephenson/stitch\">Stitch</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/sstephenson/eco\">Eco</a>.</p>\n<h2>A few conclusions</h2>\n<p>Backbone.js rocks. It makes creating highly interactive, responsive interfaces almost trivial while keeping your code neatly organized. It’s a very neat round-up of the best patterns for creating Javascript applications.</p>\n<p>Hand-rolling a way to securely connect Drupal and Node.js was a pain—probably the hardest part of building the feature. Use the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/nodejs\">Node.js Integration module</a> if you’re on Drupal 7.</p>\n<p>Redis is really impressive. It has one of the shallowest learning curve of any technology I’ve used. I was up and running with it in perhaps 15 minutes. Add that it’s incredibly fast and you have a very handy tool to add to your toolset.</p>\n<p>Note: the demo site that was linked from here is now off-line.</p>","excerpt":"Recently, for fun and learning, I built a group chatroom feature for Drupal 6.x.
